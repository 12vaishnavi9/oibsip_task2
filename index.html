        <p> <strong>Mother Teresa:</strong> Mother Teresa was the founder of the Order of the Missionaries of
            Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to helping the poor</p>
        <p>1910: A saint is born.</p>

        <p>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910. Mother Teresa’s
            parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, were of Albanian descent; her father was an entrepreneur who worked
            as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. The Bojaxhius were a devoutly
            Catholic family, and Nikola was deeply involved in the local church as well as in city politics as a vocal
            proponent of Albanian independence.</p>

            <p>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Uskup, Ottoman Empire (now Skopje, North Macedonia), on August 26, 1910. Her family was of Albanian descent. At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God. She knew she had to be a missionary to spread the love of Christ. At the age of eighteen she left her parental home in Skopje and joined the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. After a few months’ training in Dublin she was sent to India, where on May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948 Mother Teresa taught at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta, but the suffering and poverty she glimpsed outside the convent walls made such a deep impression on her that in 1948 she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent school and devote herself to working among the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta. Although she had no funds, she depended on Divine Providence, and started an open-air school for slum children. Soon she was joined by voluntary helpers, and financial support was also forthcoming. This made it possible for her to extend the scope of her work.
